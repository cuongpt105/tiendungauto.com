If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\r\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\r\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\r\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\r\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\r\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\r\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\r\n *\r\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\r\n *\r\n * \\@stable\r\n */\r\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} _renderer\r\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\r\n     */\r\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\r\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\r\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._idCounter = 0;\r\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\r\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} value\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\r\n        if (id == null) {\r\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\r\n        }\r\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\r\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} fn\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\r\n            _this.value = valueString;\r\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\r\n        };\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} fn\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

These come in handy when you want to perform validation\r\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * const form = new FormGroup({\r\n *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\r\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\r\n * }, passwordMatchValidator);\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\r\n *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\r\n *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\r\n *\r\n * \\@stable\r\n */\r\nvar FormGroup = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} controls\r\n     * @param {?=} validator\r\n     * @param {?=} asyncValidator\r\n     */\r\n    function FormGroup(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\r\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\r\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\r\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\r\n        this.controls = controls;\r\n        this._initObservables();\r\n        this._setUpControls();\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\r\n     *\r\n     * This method does not update value or validity of the control, so for\r\n     * most cases you'll want to use {\\@link FormGroup.addControl} instead.\r\n     * @param {?} name\r\n     * @param {?} control\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = function (name, control) {\r\n        if (this.controls[name])\r\n            return this.controls[name];\r\n        this.controls[name] = control;\r\n        control.setParent(this);\r\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\r\n        return control;\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Add a control to this group.\r\n     * @param {?} name\r\n     * @param {?} control\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = function (name, control) {\r\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n        this._onCollectionChange();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Remove a control from this group.\r\n     * @param {?} name\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = function (name) {\r\n        if (this.controls[name])\r\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\r\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n        this._onCollectionChange();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Replace an existing control.\r\n     * @param {?} name\r\n     * @param {?} control\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = function (name, control) {\r\n        if (this.controls[name])\r\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\r\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\r\n        if (control)\r\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n        this._onCollectionChange();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\r\n     *\r\n     * It will return false for disabled controls.

If used\r\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\r\n * control.\r\n *\r\n * \\@howToUse\r\n *\r\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\r\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\r\n *\r\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\r\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\r\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\r\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\r\n * the domain model in your class as well.\r\n *\r\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\r\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\r\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\r\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\r\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\r\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\r\n *\r\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\r\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\r\n *\r\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\r\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\r\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\r\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\r\n *\r\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\r\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\r\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\r\n *\r\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\r\n *\r\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\r\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\r\n *\r\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\r\n *\r\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\r\n *\r\n *  \\@stable\r\n */\r\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} parent\r\n     * @param {?} validators\r\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\r\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\r\n     */\r\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\r\n        _super.call(this);\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._control = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__model__[\"c\" /* FormControl */]();\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._registered = false;\r\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\r\n        this._parent = parent;\r\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\r\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\r\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"g\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} changes\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\r\n        this._checkForErrors();\r\n        if (!this._registered)\r\n            this._setUpControl();\r\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\r\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\r\n        }\r\n        if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"h\" /* isPropertyUpdated */])(changes, this.viewModel)) {\r\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\r\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this);

Conversely,\r\n * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the\r\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).\r\n *\r\n * \\@howToUse\r\n *\r\n * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a {\\@link FormControl} instance directly.\r\n * Simply create a {\\@link FormControl}, save it to your component class, and pass it into the\r\n * {\\@link FormControlDirective}.\r\n *\r\n * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike {\\@link FormControlName},\r\n * it does not require that your {\\@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent\r\n * {\\@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {\\@link FormGroupDirective} that\r\n * exists above it.\r\n *\r\n * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\r\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance.

You do\r\n * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.\r\n *\r\n * ### How to use select controls with form directives\r\n *\r\n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\r\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\r\n *\r\n * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property\r\n * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\r\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\r\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\r\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\r\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\r\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\r\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\r\n *\r\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\r\n *\r\n * \\@stable\r\n */\r\nexport var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} _renderer\r\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\r\n     */\r\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\r\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\r\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._idCounter = 0;\r\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\r\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} value\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\r\n        if (id == null) {\r\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\r\n        }\r\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\r\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} fn\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\r\n            _this.value = valueString;\r\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\r\n        };\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} fn\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

If used\r\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\r\n * control.\r\n *\r\n * \\@howToUse\r\n *\r\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\r\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\r\n *\r\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\r\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\r\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\r\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\r\n * the domain model in your class as well.\r\n *\r\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\r\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\r\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\r\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\r\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\r\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\r\n *\r\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\r\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\r\n *\r\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\r\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\r\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\r\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\r\n *\r\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\r\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\r\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\r\n *\r\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\r\n *\r\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\r\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\r\n *\r\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\r\n *\r\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\r\n *\r\n *  \\@stable\r\n */\r\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} parent\r\n     * @param {?} validators\r\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\r\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\r\n     */\r\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\r\n        _super.call(this);\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._control = new FormControl();\r\n        /** @internal */\r\n        this._registered = false;\r\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\r\n        this._parent = parent;\r\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\r\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\r\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} changes\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\r\n        this._checkForErrors();\r\n        if (!this._registered)\r\n            this._setUpControl();\r\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\r\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\r\n        }\r\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\r\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\r\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * @return {?}\r\n     */\r\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\r\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\r\n        /**\r\n         * @return {?}\r\n         */\r\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\r\n        enumerable: true,\r\n        configurable: true\r\n    });\r\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\r\n        /**\r\n         * @return {?}\r\n         */\r\n        get: function () {\r\n            return this._parent ?

Conversely,\r\n * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the\r\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).\r\n *\r\n * \\@howToUse\r\n *\r\n * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a {\\@link FormControl} instance directly.\r\n * Simply create a {\\@link FormControl}, save it to your component class, and pass it into the\r\n * {\\@link FormControlDirective}.\r\n *\r\n * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike {\\@link FormControlName},\r\n * it does not require that your {\\@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent\r\n * {\\@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {\\@link FormGroupDirective} that\r\n * exists above it.\r\n *\r\n * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\r\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in\r\n * {\\@link AbstractControl}.\r\n *\r\n * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {\\@link FormControl},\r\n * or you can set it programmatically later using {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or\r\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\r\n *\r\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\r\n * subscribe to the {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to\r\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\r\n * re-calculated.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\r\n *\r\n * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\r\n *\r\n *  \\@stable\r\n */\r\nexport var FormControlDirective = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(FormControlDirective, _super);\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {?} validators\r\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\r\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\r\n     */\r\n    function FormControlDirective(validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\r\n        _super.call(this);\r\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\r\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\r\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\r\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\r\n    }\r\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlDirective.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\r\n        /**\r\n         * @param {?} isDisabled\r\n         * @return {?}\r\n         */\r\n        set: function (isDisabled) { ReactiveErrors.disabledAttrWarning();

Conversely,\r\n * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the\r\n * {\\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).\r\n *\r\n * \\@howToUse\r\n *\r\n * This directive is designed to be used with a parent {\\@link FormGroupDirective} (selector:\r\n * `[formGroup]`).\r\n *\r\n * It accepts the string name of the {\\@link FormControl} instance you want to\r\n * link, and will look for a {\\@link FormControl} registered with that name in the\r\n * closest {\\@link FormGroup} or {\\@link FormArray} above it.\r\n *\r\n * **Access the control**: You can access the {\\@link FormControl} associated with\r\n * this directive by using the {\\@link AbstractControl.get} method.\r\n * Ex: `this.form.get('first');`\r\n *\r\n * **Get value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the {\\@link FormControl}.\r\n * See a full list of available properties in {\\@link AbstractControl}.\r\n *\r\n *  **Set value**: You can set an initial value for the control when instantiating the\r\n *  {\\@link FormControl}, or you can set it programmatically later using\r\n *  {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\r\n *\r\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\r\n * subscribe to the {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to\r\n * {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\r\n * re-calculated.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.\r\n *\r\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}\r\n *\r\n * To see `formControlName` examples with different form control types, see:\r\n *\r\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\r\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\r\n *\r\n * **npm package**:
